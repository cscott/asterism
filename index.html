<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h2>How did you meet?</h2>

<p>In theory, Jessica and Scott first met each other in 2002 (or maybe
2001 or 2000) at an MIT <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Mystery_Hunt">puzzle-solving
event</a>, since they were both members of the same team (ACME).
Neither of them remember anything about the other, however, until <a
href="http://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/hunthistory.html">2004</a>, when they
co-led the puzzle-hunting team together in a pattern that would become
familiar: Scott providing enthusiasm and Jessica taking care of
logistics.  Scott's attempts to date Jessica afterward threatened to
falter in the face of Jessica's busy dancing schedule, until she
proposed a remedy: that Scott learn to dance.  That proved to be a
solution which allowed them to spend increasing amounts of time
together &mdash; finally resulting in a proposal on October 23,
2010, via wooden jigsaw puzzle, on a trip to Portland, Maine.</p>

<h2>Why Hawaii?  Why Boston?</h2>

<p>Jessica grew up in Pearl City, Hawaii, and her family lives
there.  Scott grew up in Alabama, New Jersey, Honduras, and Guatemala,
but his family is mostly in New Jersey and South Carolina.  Jessica
and Scott went to MIT and now live in Somerville, Massachusetts
and many of their friends are in that area.  It was impossible to find
a single location that would be convenient for everyone, sadly.
Having the wedding near the bride's family in Hawaii, and having a
reception in Boston for those who couldn't manage the long trip to
Hawaii seemed the best compromise.</p>

<h2>Can I come to both?</h2>

<p>Yes! We hope we've invited you to the event that would be the most fun
and convenient for you to attend. If we've guessed incorrectly,
please let us know &mdash; or just fill out the <a
href="#rsvp">RSVP</a> form for the event you'd prefer to attend.</p>

<h2>Weather &amp; Clothing in Hawaii</h2>

<p>June weather is typically warm, relatively humid, with little
chance of sustained rain (refreshing rain showers of a minute or two
are possible).  The ceremony will be in the evening, so it should not
be overly hot.  If you want more numbers, you can look at the <a
href="http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/PHNL/1995/6/23/PlannerHistory.html?dayend=25&amp;monthend=6&amp;yearend=1995&amp;req_city=Honolulu&amp;req_state=HI&amp;req_statename=Hawaii">historical
weather summary for Hawaii in June</a> from the Weather Underground.
</p>

<h2>Weather &amp; Clothing in Boston</h2>

<p>As <a
href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Mark_Twain#New_England_Weather.2C_speech_to_the_New_England_Society_.28December_22.2C_1876.29">Mark
Twain once said</a>, "One of the brightest gems in the New England
weather is the dazzling uncertainty of it."  That said, we can give
you the <a
href="http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KBOS/1995/7/30/PlannerHistory.html?dayend=30&amp;monthend=7&amp;yearend=1995">numbers
from the Weather Underground</a>: average high is 82 F and average
low is 67 F.  And if you don't like that, just wait a minute!</p>
