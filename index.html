<div id="faq" class="faq">
<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h2>How did you meet?</h2>

<p>In theory, Jessica and Scott first met each other in 2002 (or maybe
2001 or 2000) at an MIT <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Mystery_Hunt">puzzle-solving
event</a>, since they were both members of the same team (ACME).
Neither of them remember anything about the other, however, until <a
href="http://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/hunthistory.html">2004</a>, when they
co-led the puzzle-hunting team together in a pattern that would become
familiar: Scott providing enthusiasm and Jessica taking care of
logistics.  Scott's attempts to date Jessica afterward threatened to
falter in the face of Jessica's busy dancing schedule, until she
proposed a remedy: that Scott learn to dance.  That proved to be a
solution which allowed them to spend increasing amounts of time
together&mdash;resulting finally in a proposal on October 23,
2010, via <a href="#puzzle">wooden jigsaw puzzle</a>, on a trip to
Portland, Maine.</p>

<h2>Why Hawaii?  Why Boston?</h2>

<p>Jessica grew up in Pearl City, Hawai'i, and her family lives
there.  Scott grew up in Alabama, New Jersey, Honduras, and Guatemala,
but his family is mostly in New Jersey and South Carolina.  Jessica
and Scott went to MIT and now live in Somerville, Massachusetts,
and many of their friends are in that area.  It was impossible to find
a single location that would be convenient for everyone, sadly.
Having the wedding near the bride's family in Hawai'i, and having a
reception in Boston for those who couldn't manage the long trip to
Hawai'i, seemed the best compromise.</p>

<h2>Can I come to both?</h2>

<p>Yes! We hope we've invited you to the event that would be the most fun
and convenient for you to attend. If we've guessed incorrectly,
please let us know &mdash; or just fill out the <a
href="#rsvp">RSVP</a> form for the event you'd prefer to attend.</p>

<h2>When should I arrive in Hawaii?</h2>

  <p>Jessica and Scott are arriving June 19 and leaving July 3.  We may be
pretty busy before the wedding, but of course you're welcome to sight-see on
your own.  After the wedding, we'd love to socialize with
our friends and family&mdash;our honeymoon doesn't start until July 5.
(For example, you might want to join us on a <a href="#hawaii-after">trip
to Hilo</a>.)
</p>

<h2>Weather &amp; Clothing in Hawaii</h2>

<p>June weather is typically warm, relatively humid, with little
chance of sustained rain (refreshing rain showers of a minute or two
are possible).  The ceremony will be in the evening, so it should not
be overly hot.  If you want more numbers, you can look at the <a
href="http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/PHNL/1995/6/23/PlannerHistory.html?dayend=25&amp;monthend=6&amp;yearend=1995&amp;req_city=Honolulu&amp;req_state=HI&amp;req_statename=Hawaii">historical
weather summary for Hawai'i in June</a> from the Weather Underground.
</p>

<h2>Weather &amp; Clothing in Boston</h2>

<p>As <a
href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Mark_Twain#New_England_Weather.2C_speech_to_the_New_England_Society_.28December_22.2C_1876.29">Mark
Twain once said</a>, "One of the brightest gems in the New England
weather is the dazzling uncertainty of it."  That said, we can give
you the <a
href="http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KBOS/1995/7/30/PlannerHistory.html?dayend=30&amp;monthend=7&amp;yearend=1995">average
numbers from the Weather Underground for July 30</a>:
average high is 82 F and average
low is 67 F.  And if you don't like that, just wait a minute!</p>

<div id="puzzle" class="puzzle">
  <h1>Engagement Puzzle</h1>

  <p>The engagement puzzle is in three parts.</p>

  <p>The first given to Jessica consists of the floral borders and the
  pieces between them.  It contains various pictures representing
  Jessica and Scott's life together up to the present: the Red Sox,
  square dancing, MIT, the mystery hunt, favorite board games, and so
  on.</p>

  <p>After this was completed, the second set of pieces were given,
  which are the four corners.  These form a rebus: puzzle editor Will
  Shortz, an ewe, Mary Poppins, and the musical note "mi".</p>

  <p>After an answer was received, the final set of pieces forms the
  red center.  These contain cut-outs representing our future
  together.</p>

<div id="vangogh" class="vangogh">
<h1>Van Gogh</h1>

  <p>Our wedding invitations and website have a loose theme based on
  a small painting Scott made, which was in its turn inspired by Van
  Gogh's <i><a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vincent_van_Gogh_(1853-1890)_-_Wheat_Field_with_Crows_(1890).jpg">Wheatfield
  with Crows</a></i>.
</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="images/engage1-400.jpg" width="400" height="554"
          alt="Scott's painting, next to a save-the-date card" /></p>

  <p>The cobalt blue in the sky is one of Scott's favorite colors,
  while the red-orange of the poppies in the wheatfield below is close to
  Jessica's favorite shade.  The painting unites these two elements.
  The textures on the website and in the invitations are drawn from
  several different paintings Scott made on this theme.
  </p>

  <p>One of the stops on our honeymoon will be the
  <a href="http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=3343&amp;lang=en">Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam</a>, where we hope to see
  the original <i>Wheatfield with Crows</i>.</p>

  <!--
  <p>In 199x, Jessica had XY minutes to spend in Amsterdam's Van Gogh
  museum during a whirlwind tour of Europe.</p>
  <p>Other design elements include fiddlehead ferns and pincushion
  protea,  native to Hawaii.(well, the protea grows well in Kona, but
  is actually native to South Africa.</p>
